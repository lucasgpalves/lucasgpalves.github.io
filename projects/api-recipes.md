Taberu Food API is an application interface that has been created to communicate between the requests made by the user on the frontend and the backend. As a BFF API, it has been custom developed, taking the business rules requested by the business.

Taberu Food API is implemented locally, with the possibility of being deployed in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), developed in [Spring](https://spring.io/) and connected to [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). It was developed in 2 weeks, I created a user registration system, use of tokens for authentication, creation of books, etc.

In this project I gained backend development experience in creating the application and creating the database. 

This project is associated with another which is the generation of books, which is another API, but developed in Python and FastAPI.
