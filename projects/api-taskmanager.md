Task Manager is an API, which I developed using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and services already integrated within the framework. I used some external services such as [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) to perform the migrations and to create the tables in the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

As this is a simple application, I applied good coding practices, using the files as if they were classes. Following SOLID principles in each file, I intend to use this project as a basis for future studies on architecture, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), etc.
